Currently, I'm fortunate to work as a research assistant following Prof. Chao Zhang . Before joining Tech, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised (as research intern) by Prof. Wentao Han , Prof. Jie Tang and Prof. Dan Pei . My ultimate research goal is to build self-evolving AI that can serve as active learner and make interactions with human and real world efficiently. My primary research focuses on machine learning and real-world NLP tasks: Data-efficient ML with self-supervision , ML4H 2023 Large language models (LLMs) with external guidance , in progress! ML theory , IJCNN 2020 I'm actively seeking Ph.D. chances in Fall 2024. Please check my CV or LinkedIn if you are interested in me!

Zhihan Li, Youjian Zhao, Haowen Xu, Wenxiao Chen, Shangqing Xu , Yilin Li and Dan Pei. Unsupervised Clustering through Gaussian Mixture Variational AutoEncoder with Non-Reparameterized Variational Inference and Std Annealing. 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). Other Papers Shangqing Xu , Wentao Han, End-to-end Code Parallelization by Pre-trained Neural Language Models, Tsinghua University Graduate Thesis Misc If you are interested in how my name is pronounced in Chinese, it sounds like 'Shawn-Chin Shoo'. I'm especially interested in reading novels. My favorites are Le Comte de Monte-Cristo and the Foundation series (which contributes to my research interest fairly a lot). Visual novel games are also of my preferences, among which I enjoy Steins; Gate and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim the most.","title":"Shangqing Xu (\u5f90\u5c1a\u9752)"},{"location":"#shangqing-xu","text":"","title":"Shangqing Xu (\u5f90\u5c1a\u9752)"},{"location":"#bio","text":"I'm a second-year Master's student of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.
