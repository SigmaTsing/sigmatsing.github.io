Aditya Prakash . I also work closely with Prof. Chao Zhang . Previous to my PhD study, I obtained my Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. Before joining Tech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. In Tsinghua, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Wentao Han , Prof. Jie Tang and Prof. Dan Pei . My ultimate research goal is to build self-evolving AI that can serve as active learner and make interactions with human and real world efficiently.

Other Papers Shangqing Xu , End-to-end Code Parallelization by Pre-trained Neural Language Models, Tsinghua University Graduate Thesis Misc If you are interested in how my name is pronounced in Chinese, it sounds like 'Shawn-Chin Shoo'. I'm especially interested in reading novels. My favorites are Le Comte de Monte-Cristo and the Foundation series (which contributes to my research interest fairly a lot). Visual novel games are also of my preferences, among which I enjoy Steins; Gate and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim the most.","title":"Shangqing Xu (\u5f90\u5c1a\u9752)"},{"location":"#shangqing-xu","text":"","title":"Shangqing Xu (\u5f90\u5c1a\u9752)"},{"location":"#bio","text":"I'm a first-year PhD student of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. B.
